# ChatGPT Writing Assistant Chrome & Brave Extension

## Overview

ChatGPT Writing Assistant is a Chrome extension that allows users to improve their writing directly in Google Docs and other text input fields by selecting different writing styles (Professional, Casual, Polite, Social Media).

## Features

- **Context Menu for Writing Styles**: Right-click on selected text to choose from various writing styles (Professional, Casual, Polite, Social Media).
- **Real-time Text Transformation**: The selected text is automatically converted to the chosen style using OpenAI's API.
